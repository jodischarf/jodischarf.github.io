I am currently pursuing pursuing my Master of Public Health (MPH) at [Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), studying Public Health Research Methods in the [Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/population-family-health). I received a BA in Contemplative Studies from Brown University in 2019.

<br>

My interests include mental health & psychosocial support (MHPSS) research, child & adolescent health, mindfulness-based intervention development and implementation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
